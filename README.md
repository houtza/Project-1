shell.c : A basic shell program to execute commands from
Project_1_README.txt

Instructions
Compile using "gcc -o shell shell.c" then enter "./shell" to run.

Challenges
Our biggest challenge was getting our input string correctly parssed and passed into execvp. Our second biggest challenge 
was figuring out how to get the change directory code implemented.

Sources

Stack exchange was used to find information about the getcwd() function for printing the current working directory 
as well as how to print in color.  Example code from class was also used as a guide when 
writting the code for the child fork. The man pages were used heavily as well
